<p>
Dartium is a special build of Chromium that includes the Dart VM.
Using Dartium means you don't have to compile your code to JavaScript
until you're ready to test on other browsers.
To learn about other tools you can use for Dart development,
see <a href="/tools/">Tools for Dart</a>.

<h2 id="download">Getting Dartium</h2>

<p>
  If you have an up-to-date version of
  <a href="/tools/editor/">Dart Editor</a>,
  you already have Dartium.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, you can <a href="/tools/download.html">download Dartium</a> directly.

</section>

<h2 id="install">Installing Dartium</h2>

<p>
  You donâ€™t usually need to do anything special to install Dartium:
  just unarchive the ZIP file.
  If you want Dart Editor to launch a particular copy of Dartium,
  then put that copy inside the <code>dart-sdk</code> directory
  of your Dart Editor installation directory,
  replacing its original copy of Chromium.
</p>
